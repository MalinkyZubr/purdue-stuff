# Probability and z score
## relative probability
* likelihood of one occurence compared to anpther
* do we have a population or sample?
* probability = # occurences / sample-size
* z-score
  * distance from the average of the bell curve
    * that is the middle of the bell curve
* the probability of something happening can be expressed as z score
  * probability of a z-score of -1.5 or less? just find the area under the curve at -1.5 and below
  * the z score is the area under the curve, since the curve is 1 in total
* ztables
  * allow to find probabilities
    * standard table
* when you want to find area to negative z-score, you use negative z table
* when to find posiitive z score, use positive z table
* anything to the right of the z score should be found using 1 - z_score_area
* must calculate means and standard deviation first
* z_score = (value - mean) / standard deviation
  * where value is a value from the dataset
