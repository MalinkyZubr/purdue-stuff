## Histograms
* shows type or curve of frequency
* first step towards understanding a problem
* determine the spread of the data?
* requirements met>
* differences in output?
* anatomy
  * frequency of occurences in continuous dataset
  * each bar represents a range of data, called bins
  * x axis is the variable
  * y axis is the frequnecy
  * uses inclusive exclusive interval notation
* distributions
  * gaussian distribution: bell curve
  * skewed distribution: shifted to one side
  * kurtosis: heavy or light tails 
    * datasets with lots of outliers have heavy tails, those with few have light tails
    * when the change from tail to bell is less steep, this is heavy kurtosis
  * when there is a skew, check data
* no gaps between bars, histogram is continuous data!
* if there are gaps, that means there is no data for that range
