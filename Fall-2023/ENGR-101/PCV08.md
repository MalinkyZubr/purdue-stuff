## Descriptive Statistics
* describes data
* why?
  * someone sends a table of what looks like random numbers
  * we want to understand variance and trends
  * we can analyze, predict, and make decisions using descriptive statistics

* measures of central tendency
  * mean: reduce noice and variation
    * approximate data and eliminate small variances in data.
    * vulnerable to large outliers and erroneous measurements
  * median
    * find the number in the middle of the data array
  * mode
    * what value occurs the most in the dataset?

* deviant measurements
  * standard deviation:
    * how far is the data spread from the average
    * (sum(each_value - population_mean)^2 / population_size)^0.5
    * 2 functions in excel
      * stdev.p()
        * all data in the entire population
      * stdev.s()
        * most data is a sample, so we use this
  * variance:
    * standard deviation squared
    * 2 functions
      * var.p()
      * var.s()
        * like stdev, use this
  * range
    * max - min
