## Problem Scoping
* understanding a problem
* problems arent defined, must get a deep understanding of the issue
* understand client and user needs first and foremost
  * empathetic design strategies
    * observation
    * interview
    * gain perspective
  * who is clinet?
  * their needs?
  * additional info?
  * user insights?
  * potential users?
  * design requirements?
  * limitations? constraints?
* problem scoping is iterative, and will often occur during other parts of design process
* continue to review and revise the rpoblem statement


* need != solution

* problem statement
  * 1 or 2 sentences 
  * interpretation of clients needs 
  * refers to client/stakeholders
  * states needs or problem
  * what is the importance?
* specifications
  * design criteria
    * needs and wants
      * affordable, easy to use, lightweight, energy efficient
  * design constraints
    * must haves
      * budget
      * dimensions
      * time
      * materials
* metrics
  * quantify design requirements
  * some things are easy to quantify
  * others require more thought
  * affordability? cost / unit

* beginner vs experienced designer
  * beginner:
    * focus on quick completion and single correct solution
  * experienced:
    * seek broad understanding of challenge
    * delay quick decisions
    * research, explore solutions
    * interviews, investigation
    * frame the problem

* treat early ideas as part of scoping
* ask questions
  * if easy solution was so easy to come up with, why not used?
* research the problem
* start exploring stakeholder requireemnts, what is needed
