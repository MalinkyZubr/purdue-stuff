* evidence based decisions on teams
* analyze and interpret data
* engineering design process
  * identify needs
  * define priblems
  * generate solutions
  * evaluate solutions
  * select solutions
* mathematical modelling
* data analytics
  * organize
  * format
  * analyze data
* professional habits
  * diverse teams
  * reflect on work of self and others

## Excel
* ctrl s to save
* enter to move to row below
* tab to move sideways, or arrows
### Combining Data
* create new workbooks and copy contents from both
* save one under a new name and copy from one

## Calculations
* supports all basic math operations in operator and functional form.
* addition is SUM()
* to get percentage of a number, do `num * x%`

### order of operations
1. reverse number: -
2. operations with percents: %
3. raising to the power: ^
4. mutliplication and division: * /
5. addition and subtraction + -
6. concatenation/comparison: ><
* anything in parentheses is done first

### Referencing
* relative
  * default reference form
  * referenced cell location is relative to the referencing cell. If the referencing cell is changed, the cells it references change as well
* absolute
  * configure this by adding a $ before the reference in the white box above the sheet
  * the referenced cell will be the same no matter what this way
    * fixed column: $D4
    * fixed row: D$4
  * pressing f4 on a reference will turn it to be absolute column, row, then relative again

### Pasting
* there are many options for pasting, which allow pasting of formulas, or pasting the data calculated by formulas in cells

### Stress and strain curves
* A graphical method to show the mechanical behavior, reaction of a material when force is applied
* necessary to classify materials, and select materials for applications
  * airplane wings
  * mechanical joints

#### Stress
* sigma
* stress = F / A
  * applied force on an object divided by initial cross-sectional area that the force acts upon

#### Strain
* the change in length of an object over the initial length of the object
* (L1 - L0) / L0 = E (curly E, epsilon)

#### Tensile Test
* machine pulls a material bar apart, and measures the force, and the change in length of the material, until the bar breaks

#### Different Stresses
* yield stress
  * SIGMA(ys), the stress threshold at which the material becomes permanently deformed
  * any point before this, if the material is released, it will return to its original shape
* ultimate tensile stress
  * SIGMA(uts)
  * maximum stress before the material fractures
* fracture stress 
  * SIGMA(fs)
  * stress at which the material break

#### Elastic Modulus
* E: Defines resistance of a material to deformation while stress is applied
* you can find this in the elastic region before the yield stress point
  * this is linear. The slope of the line is the elastic modulus
  * we also assume that strain lies between 0 and 0.0002
* this is measured in giga pascals
* accepted modulus in industry is 210 GPa
