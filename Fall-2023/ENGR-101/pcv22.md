* water potential energy = pgh
  * p = density
  * g = acceleration gravity
  * h = height from top of water in upper reservoir to the turbine
* kinetic energy
  * 1/2 mv^2
* Power = EpQgP
  * E = efficiency factor
    * what percent fo eneergy is converted?
  * p = density of water
    * 1000 kg/m^3
  * Q = volumetric flow rate
    * change in volume of water in upper reservoir over time
  * g = gravitational acceleration constant
  * P = pressure head
