## solar power
* solar panel
  * made of solar cells
layers
1. glass
   1. insulator, no electricity escapes
   2. transparent
   3. protect the other fragile layers
2. antireflection
   1. light isnt let out. Doesnt reflect any light
   2. coating is transparent but is of specific lenght relative to wavelength
   3. this is the oil on water problem with quantum mechanics all over again
   4. the light waves cancel out and none is reflected
3. grid pattern
   1. must be a grid so light can get through
   2. must also be dense enough so electrons can travel easy
4. semiconductors
   1. silicon
   2. we want light to make the material conductive
   3. silicon has only 4 electrons, all used for bonding
      1. enhanced used doping
      2. inject phosphorus!
      3. phosphorus has extra electrons
      4. inject some boron!
      5. boron want more electrons
      6. electron gradient = moving electrons!
      7. phosphoru sbecomes positive, boron becomes negative
      8. electfic field, voltage 
5. back conductor

* one solar cell is about 0.5 volts
* many cells needed for real power
